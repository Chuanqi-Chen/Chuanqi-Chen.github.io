I am currently a PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at University of Wisconsin–Madison. I work under the guidance of Prof. Jinlong Wu. I obtained my B.S. in Statistics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and M.S. in Industrial Systems Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech).

My research focuses on the intersection of computational mathematics, data science and engineering. I work on development and application of AI algorithms and data-driven methods to solve problems in science, engineering, and industry. The topics relevant to my interests include scientific machine learning, data assimilation, uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, dynamical systems, generative learning, and digital twins.
